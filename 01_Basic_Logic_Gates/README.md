Objective: The objective of this project is to understand and implement basic digital logic gates using PLC ladder logic. These gates form the foundation of industrial automation programming.

📘 Software Used:

RSLogix 500

RSLinx Classic

PLC Emulator 500

📘 Logic Gates 


1️⃣ NOT Gate

Boolean Expression: Y = A'

Description:
The NOT gate inverts the input signal.
If input is ON (1), output becomes OFF (0).
If input is OFF (0), output becomes ON (1).

2️⃣ AND Gate
Boolean Expression: Y = A • B
Description:
Output turns ON only when both inputs are ON.
If any one input is OFF, output remains OFF.

3️⃣ OR Gate
Boolean Expression: Y = A + B
Description:
Output turns ON if at least one input is ON.
Both inputs do not need to be ON.

4️⃣ NAND Gate
Boolean Expression: Y = (A • B)'
Description:
Output is OFF only when both inputs are ON.
In all other conditions, output remains ON.

5️⃣ NOR Gate
Boolean Expression: Y = (A + B)'
Description:
Output turns ON only when both inputs are OFF.
If any input becomes ON, output turns OFF.
