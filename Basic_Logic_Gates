Objective : The objective of this project is to understand and implement basic digital logic gates using PLC ladder logic. These gates form the foundation of industrial automation programming.

 Software Used:

RSLogix 500
RSLinx Classic
PLC Emulator (if used)

Logic Gates Implemented

1️⃣ NOT Gate
Boolean Expression : Y = A'

Description : Output turns ON when input is OFF.

2️⃣ AND Gate
Boolean Expression : Y = A • B

3️⃣ OR Gate
Boolean Expression : Y = A + B

4️⃣ NAND Gate
Boolean Expression : Y = (A • B)'

5️⃣ NOR Gate
Boolean Expression : Y = (A + B)'
